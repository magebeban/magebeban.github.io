<p class="message">
  The vision of Church Deploy is to enable churches to have access to a fast, scalable, open-source website framework to assisting in spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ through local churches.
</p>

## Mission Statement

> Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. 
> **Acts 4:32** (ESV)

<p class="no-space"><br/></p>

> For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.  
> **2 Corinthians 9:12** (ESV)

The mission of Church Deploy is to build, as a community, the best church website framework possible and give it away, free of charge. We believe that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the most incredible gift ever given to humanity, and we desire for churches to be better-equipped to share the Gospel with this dying world and to build up the Church globally for the work of the ministry.

## How To Accomplish This Mission

Just like the Church in Acts shared all things in common to work together on mission with Christ, we too desire to work together as a community to build a robust, forward-looking web framework, built on open technologies, that will enable churches to build better websites, create them faster, and save money, time and resources in the process. This should enable those resources to be freed up to do greater things for the glory of Christ and improve the way churches communicate the Gospel.

As a group of independent web and digital practitioners who are Christians, we welcome anyone who desires to contribute time, effort, brains and technical-geekery to help build this project and grow the future of church websites.

## The Genesis of ChurchDeploy

We started out, as a team of 5, to redesign a website for our church. As we began thinking through the mechanics and tinkering with the project on our spare time, we realized that not only could we use help building such a large project, but we also started to realize that some of the foundations we were building and exploring could prove to be useful for other churches in the same position, with limited staff, budget, time and resources.

So with that in mind, ChurchDeploy was born. Hopefully, from our shared skill-sets and experience we can build something much bigger than a single church website, and give something back to the church or any ministry that desires a better platform for communicating to their audiences.

## Our Technology Stack

ChurchDeploy is being built on [Symphony CMS](http://symphony-cms.com/), an open source XSLT framework. It uses a tag-based architecture to carve up content in  strategic ways that will benefit the specific needs, content and audience of churches. We are baking into it a set of APIs that will enable easy access to plug in content from Flickr, Tumblr, Ustream, Vimeo, and many other sources.

ChurchDeploy is currently being hosted on GitHub, as this is the best platform we have found to build a next-generation framework collaboratively and give it away to the world.

## How You Can Help

We are looking for robots, coding monkeys, developers, front-end stylists, and nerdy web folk of all kinds who are able to contribute time, energy and top-notch code to help build the future of church websites together. Contact us below and/or hop on GitHub and join us in building ChurchDeploy.
